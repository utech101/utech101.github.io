	<br>
	
	<b> High Level Vision: </b>
		<p 	style="text-align:left;color:black;font-size:90%"> To meet business requirements of 
		customers by providing effective and efficient software applications, maintaining high customer satisfaction and adapting to new
		software development technologies.</P>
	

	
	<b> Rationale: </b>
		<p 	style="text-align:Left;color:black;font-size:90%">  This software development project is designed to increase the user’s 
		engagement as well as improving the quality of the current web application. The idea of the software project is to increase the customer satisfaction 
		for the users of the system. In addition, the bottom line of the proposal software project is to enhance and offer top tier software quality solutions 
		that can increase revenue for the university. Once the online web application is well built, customer experience will be better and in turn can bring 
		the business to new heights.</P>
	
	
	<b> Stakeholders:</b>
		<p 	style="color:black;font-size:90%"> The stakeholders of a project typically are people or groups affected by a 
		software development project. The stakeholder of the software project includes the project team which consist of three members namely Jade Robinson, Michael Jones 
		and Andre Cameron.Other stakeholders include the project sponsor, customers and end users.</P>
	
	<h4 style =" font-family:Times New Roman;color:black;text-align:center;font-size:180%;"> Starting Assumptions and Constraints:</h4>
	<h4 style =" color:black;text-align:center;font-size:150%;">Starting Assumptions </h4>
	
	<h4>1.	Project Scope – the scope of what plan to deliver.</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>  The project scope will remain the same once the stakeholders sign off on the scope statement.</li>
	</ul>  
	
	<h4>2.  Project Schedule: tasks, durations and dependencies needed to finish the project.</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>	Materials will arrive on time and adhere to the project schedule.</li>
	</ul> 
	
	<h4>3.  Budget of the software project – estimated price of the project</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>	Project costs will remain the same as initially budgeted expenditure.</li>
	  <li>	Training will be conducted internally with no additional training expenses incurred.</li>
	</ul> 
	
	<h4>4.  Resources:</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>	During the time they consent to tests, end users would be available to test.</li>
	  <li>	Training rooms will be provided at the training center where necessary.</li>
	</ul> 
	
	<h4>5.  Our project team members have all the required skills to complete the project within time and budget.</h4>
	
	 <h4 style =" color:black;text-align:center;font-size:150%;">Constraints </h4>
	
		<strong>
		<p 	style="text-align:left;color:black;font-size:110%"> The constraints of this software development project will consist of the following:</p>
		</strong>
		
	<ol>
		<li>Time: There will be deadlines to be met and these will be given by the project sponsor. The project should be completed in one semester (13 weeks).</li>
		<li>Cost: The software project should be completed within budget that the project sponsor will propose. The project should be completed in a $10,000 USD budget.</li>
		<li>Scope: The scope describes what needs to be completed. An upgraded UtechOnline platform needs to be done.</li>
		<li>Quality: The quality constraint of the project will affect the cost of the project. If there is a strict quality requirement of the project, then it will directly affect the cost to complete the project.
		The quality of the project depends on the project sponsor’s budget.</li>
		<li>Risk: The risk constraint can be positive or negative. The positive risks must be enhanced, and the negative risk should be reduced in the project.</li>
		<li>Customer Satisfaction: This is a crucial constraint for the project because the customers are the source of income and reaching the bottom line of the business.</li>
		<li>Resources: The project team are not the only resources in the project but also the tools, equipment that are used during the duration of the project.</li>
	</ol>

	<h1 style =" color:black;text-align:center;font-size:150%;">Work Plan</h1>
		<b> Objective for Project:</b>
	<ul>
	  <li>To make an overall improvement of Utech’s online platform for students to interact with their teachers. </li>
	  <li>Implement an easy to find and use search bar by which students can access their course information quickly and efficiently.</li>
	  <li>Implement a system where modules that were done from previous semesters are still present on the dashboard even in the future semesters and students should only see 
	  modules that they are currently doing as it would be the focus for them.  </li>
	  <li>To deliver an effective and efficient software platform within time and budget.</li>
	  <li>Improve the user interface to improve the useability on the site and make it more appealing to the eye to new and existing users of the site, hence making the user experience an overall better one.</li>
	 </ul>
	 
	 <b> Roles:</b>
	 <li>Software Architect/ Developer/ System Administrator - Jade Robinson</li>
	 <p> The Developer is responsible for the operational design of the solution.The Software Architect develops solutions in depth with the aid of designers and enterprises.
		System administrators maintain and monitor performance of the system.</p>
	 <li>Database Administrator/ Subject Matter Expert - Andre Cameron</li> 
	 <p>The Subject Matter Expert (SME) has an outstanding (specialist) expertise of the discipline, technology, consumer, business method or business. The Database Administrator 
		is an expert in the configuration, design and development of databases and tables used by the software implementation.</p>
	 <li>Test Engineer/Analyst/ Tester - Michael Jones </li>
	 <p>The Tester assures that the solution satisfies the market specifications and that it is free from flaws and bugs. 
		The task of the Test Analyst is to initially classify and subsequently describe the appropriate tests, track the coverage of the tests and assess the overall consistency encountered in the testing of the Target Test Products. This task 
		often includes determining the appropriate test data and assessing the result of each test cycle.</p>

<h1 style =" color:black;text-align:center;font-size:200%;">Requirement Gathering Data </h1>
<ul>
	  <li> 	After careful consideration the best three activities that are well suited for our project are Focus groups, interviews and questionnaires are three tools we are trying to use to capture results. 
		The reason for selecting these three methods is that they all offer a relatively inexpensive, fast and reliable way to acquire large volumes of data from a large sample of individuals. Data
		can also be obtained relatively easily because it would not be necessary for the researcher to be present when they are completed.
</li>
	</ul>  

<ul>
		<li>  The data will be obtained by each participant by whatsapp groups and distributed by submitting each link from google forms. 
			All three approaches will be made for the interview on google forms the questionnaires, and the focus groups will also be conducted on whatsapp and google forum with 
			  a particular group of people to collect the views, thoughts, and beliefs of people on the subject. Through systematically applying mathematical and/or logical methods to explain and demonstrate, condense and recapture, and assess data, the information can be analyzed whether through bar graphs, pie chart and tables.
		</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>	
		The timeline for this work can take a week or two depending on the person's availability to answer the questions.
