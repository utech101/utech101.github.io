<br>

<p>	Now more than ever, government agencies are being called on to reduce expenses, operate more efficiently and collaborate more effectively. 
	Cisco TelePresence enables government agencies to address these challenges head on, through high definition video communications. From the laptop to the immersive room based systems and everywhere in-between, telepresence technology can expedite decision making, 
	connect a geographically dispersed workforce and break down the barriers for inter and intra agency communication.</p>	

<p>	Governments are accelerating adoption of telework to support continuity of operations (COOP), reduce
	costs, enhance recruitment and retention, and increase environmental sustainability. This white paper,
	intended for executives planning telework strategies, explains the essential role of videoconferencing, or
	telepresence, for engaging and managing a remote government workforce:</P>

		<p style="padding-left:30px;">	• Team interactions are more efficient when participants can see each other’s facial expressions to gauge
			their reactions.</p>
		<p style="padding-left:30px;">	• Being able to see coworkers helps teleworkers feel more engaged and contributes to job satisfaction.</p>
