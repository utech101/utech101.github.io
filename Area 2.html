<br>
	<p>	Telepresence enables clinicians in remote clinics to deliver specialist
		care to citizens in rural areas. For example, the Florida Department of Health uses telepresence to
		connect specialists in interacting with abused children with emergency rooms throughout the state.
		Similarly, through a partnership between Indian Health Services and Oklahoma Department of Mental
		Health and Substance Abuse Services, an Indian Health Services clinician who believes a patient is
		exhibiting signs of depression or anxiety can spontaneously initiate a telepresence call with a behavioral
		health clinician, who can interact face–to–face with the patient to determine if mental health services are
		warranted.</p>
	<p>	Telemedicine is a rapidly growing field and, with the aid of telepresence robots, is quickly gaining traction in hospitals and homes around the world.
		In rural hospital settings where a medical specialist is physically unavailable, a robot can be deployed to check in on a patient with a physician from elsewhere. 
		In the home, a nurse can check in with a patient while they recover in a comfortable setting.Meeting these challenges requires collaboration among essential caregivers in treatment pathways,
		which is why many healthcare organizations are focusing on collaboration initiatives. </p>
